<p class="description">Eating healthy can be difficult.  With all the food options out there these days we are constantly being coerced into making bad choices nutritionally.  Without knowing what you are doing you can easily allow what you eat to explode to unhealthy levels.</p>
<p class="description">This is where Nutrition Tracker comes in.  Let us help you keep track of what you are eating and how that affects your daily consumption totals.  We not only track the calories you take in but also the macronutrients that you ingest.</p>
<h3>What are macronutrients?</h3>
<p class="description">Macronutrients are the specific types of nutrients in food that are required in large amounts for us to survive and stay healthy.  The macronutrients we consume are <strong>carbohydrates</strong>, <strong>fats</strong>, and <strong>protein</strong>.  In order to maximize the impact of our diet it is important to consume these macronutrients in the proper proportion.  Not everyone needs the exact same breakdown of macronutrients so our program allows you to customize the amount of each macronutrient you need per day and then you can track how well you adhere to those numbers</p>
<h3>How do I get started?</h3>
<p class="description">It is important before starting any diet plan or nutritional guidelines to speak with your doctor.  It can also be helpful to speak with a nutritionist that can tell you specifically what your macronutrient should be.  Once you have that information or if you feel confident moving forward, just click on the register button on the top of the page to set up your account.</p>
<p class="description">Once you have your account set up all you have to do is search for the foods you consume and add them to your list for the day.  You can go back to previous days to see how well you did.  It is just that simple.  We give you the tools to keep track of your progress, it is just up to you to make the difference in your life.  Are you ready?</p>
